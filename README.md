# Edge-detection
Implementing two edge detection algorithms in the field of image processing

This project implemented two algorithms for edge detection in the image (Edge Detection) and to improve the image obtained by using filters.
Edge recognition is helpful in identifying different objects and shapes in images by highlighting the boundaries of different objects in the image,
using different color areas in the image.
Algorithm 1: Roberts Operator implementation according to Absolute normalization, single threshold value.
Algorithm 2: Using a First & second derivative filter in the frequency plane (FD), with two threshold values.
Two images were created:
Image1 - A synthetic image of 5 rectangles of different sizes and colors.
Image2 - Image of fruits and vegetables in different colors (at least 5).
